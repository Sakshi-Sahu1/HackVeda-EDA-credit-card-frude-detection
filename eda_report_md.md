| V2 | 534 | 0.19% |

**Observations:**
- Amount feature has highest outlier concentration
- PCA features show moderate outlier presence
- Outliers may represent legitimate high-value transactions or fraud attempts

### 4.2 Anomaly Detection Performance

**Isolation Forest Results:**
- Anomalies Detected: 28,481 (10% contamination)
- Frauds in Anomalies: 354
- Precision: 1.24%

**Local Outlier Factor Results:**
- Anomalies Detected: 28,481 (10% contamination)
- Frauds in Anomalies: 267
- Precision: 0.94%

**Analysis:** Traditional anomaly detection shows low precision, highlighting the need for supervised learning approaches.
